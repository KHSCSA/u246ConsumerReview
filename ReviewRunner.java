        // activity 2a - write the 'totalSentiment' method
        // Note: this requires creating "SimpleReview.txt"
        // TIP: be sure to look for any helper methods in the Review class
        // TIP: indexOf and substring will be your friend here




        // activity 2b - write the 'starRating' method
        // this is NOT described in the book, here is one possible system
        // sentiment val      star rating
        // less than -10      0
        // less than 0        1
        // less than 10       2
        // less than 20       3
        // 20 or more         4




        // Activity 3 - a 'fakeReview'
        // TIP 1: create a new text file for this 'SimpleReview2.txt'
        // you'll also need to populate your 'positiveAdjectives.txt' file with at least 20 positive adjectives
        // TIP 2: did you notice a great helper method in Review.java? Something about adjectives?
        // Note: your final string does not require punctuation
